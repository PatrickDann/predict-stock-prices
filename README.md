This project uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks to predict stock prices based on historical data.

## Features
- Fetch stock data using the `yfinance` library.
- Preprocess and normalize data for model training.
- Train an LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Visualize predictions against actual stock prices.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/PatrickDann/predict-stock-prices.git>
